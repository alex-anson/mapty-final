## My final version of 'mapty,' a workout app from my javascript course.

- Here's the [original version](mapty.netlify.app), hosted by my instructor.
- This is a desktop-only app; I didn't add any media queries.
- Purpose of project: create an app using object oriented programming.
- Uses Local Storage and Open Street Map

On my own:

- Rebuild the objects coming from local storage
- Added functionality: edit or delete a single workout. Delete all workouts.
- Added to the UI for implementing the above.

Completed: 03 July 2021

##### Cheers!
